# Resources for Allies in Tech

Hey interwebs! What are your go-to resources for allies in tech? I have a few articles, but wouldn't mind more, videos, conf talks etc #ally

### Goal
Start to collect all resources for technical and non-technical allies who work in tech. Would love to find resources for managers, junior developers, and everyone in between whether they're a developer, design, in HR, etc! 

### How to contribute
A good ol' pull request to the repo to create or add to [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Open to creating folders for different topics and roles.

### Credit
If you feel comfortable adding your name next to a link/resource as a contributor, please do!
